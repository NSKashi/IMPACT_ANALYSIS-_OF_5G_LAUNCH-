Analyzing the Impact of 5G Launch on Wavecon

ðŸ”¹I had the fantastic chance to explore Wavecon's dashboard data and tackle essential questions through comprehensive data analysis as part of the hashtag#CodeBasicsVirtualInternship.

ðŸ”¹Key Findings

ðŸ”¹Revenue Trends:
â€¢Initial revenue spike: â‚¹3.54 billion to â‚¹3.57 billion post-launch.
â€¢Fluctuating revenue: Peak of â‚¹4.25 billion, decline to â‚¹4.00 billion by September.

ðŸ”¹User Metrics:
â€¢Active users decreased from 84.4 million to 77.4 million.
â€¢Unsubscribed users rose from 5.6 million to 7 million.

ðŸ”¹Top-Performing Plans:

â€¢Plan 2: Super Saviour Pack: Stable at â‚¹1.5 billion.
â€¢Plan 11: Ultra Fast Mega Pack: New plan with â‚¹1.9 billion in revenue.

ðŸ”¹Low-Performing Plans:
â€¢Plans 5, 6, and 7: Stagnant or declining revenue; significant drop in Plan 7 from â‚¹582.4 million to â‚¹155.6 million.
â€¢Recommendations: Consider discontinuing or upgrading underperforming plans.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to my mentors Dhaval Patel, Hemanand Vadivel, and the entire hashtag#Codebasics team for providing me with this amazing opportunity.
